# rx-basic-store

A simple reactive store for state management using RxJs. 
Can be used in React but will also work with other frameworks.

Created to seperate state management from the UI components without a lot of boilerplate code.

Inspired by this [blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/rxjs-with-react-hooks-for-state-management/) and the names of the events
are inspired by [ngxs](https://www.ngxs.io)
